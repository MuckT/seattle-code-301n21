# Feedback Review

## The Good/Going Well

- Code review, particularly the buildout from lab 6
  - We really do want to make this class as useful for you as possible; glad that was useful.
  - We'll try code reviews like that in the future, when it's relevant/most useful
- In depth labs
  - Useful for cementing knowledge
  - Building up bigger projects, lab over lab, that can be used as portfolio pieces
- Clarity of lecture content

## The Mixed

- Code challenges
  - Lots of people love them; a few people hate them
  - Meant to be warming you up for more Data Structures & Algorithms work in Code 401
  - Keep reaching out when you feel stuck or aren't able to get started.

## The Bad/Could Be Improved

- Someone asked: could we get a daily checklist of what's covered in lecture?
  - We have one! It's in the daily README inside of the class GitHub repo.
  - But, we'll also make sure that's fully fleshed-out, with all the complexity we'll cover that day, for future lectures
- The class is moving fast
  - That's still intentional, but we want it to be an achievable level of fast, not insurmountable
  - There's a difference between not knowing all of what's going on, and not knowing enough to get started
  - Stacked learning means feeling uncomfortable with how much you've learned
  - We will continue to do in-depth code reviews
  - There are also other Code Fellows folks to talk with: John, Robin, Brook are all here to listen, support you, and connect you with resources like tutoring
  - The Code 301 daytime class has finished now, and built some amazing projects--you all can get there too.
