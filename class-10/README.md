# Persistence

## Overview

Today we will talk about in-memory storage and caching, and how to apply simple in-memory caching to our applications. We'll also practice debugging some starter code together, to keep honing our debugging skills.

## Daily Plan

- Review code challenges
- [Warm-up exercise](./warm-up.md)
- In-memory persistence
  - Debugging starter code
  - Adding persistence
- Lab Overview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 10 of Code 301, students will:

- Describe and Define
  - In Memory Database
  - Cache
  - Cache Hit
  - Cache Miss
- Persist data in memory
- Understand the advantages and drawbacks to persisting data in memory vs using something like a database
